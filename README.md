# Data structures and Algorithms
Repository for data structures and algorithms.
Some of the algorithms implementations might be wrong, as i didn't spend much time on them.

# What is a Data structure
This is a method used to store data so it can be easily searched, accessed etc. 
# What is an algorithm
This is a set of instruction that accomplishes a specific task
# Analysis of algorithm
This is the approximation of the resoruces that a specific algorith uses. There Best, Worst and Average case, but worse case are ususally used.
# Sum of N natural numbers
To calculate the Sum of N natural Numbers such as 1+2+3+3 etc, you use the formula N*(N+1)/2
# Prefix sum of given array (1D array)
Given an array, we can calculate the prefix sum. So we will return an array of the same size as the given (input) array, and for each value of ReturnArray[i], we return ReturnArray[i] + inputarray[i -1]
# Prefix sum with Q queries
SKIP FOR NOW
# Prefix Sum of given matrix
SKIP for Now
# Reverse an integer
This algorithm is very simple. So to get this working, we have to set up a variable which hold the actual reversed result and firsly initialise it to 0. Next we use the formula (res*10) + Input%10, and after you upate the input value with the forumal of Inputvalue = InputValue/10.
# HashMap
This is the concept of Key-Value pair
# Vectors
